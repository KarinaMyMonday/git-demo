Sing me a song of a lass that is gone
Say, could that lass be I
Merry of soul, she sailed on a day
Over the sea to Skye

Billow and breeze, islands and seas
Mountains of rain and sun (mountains of rain and sun)
All that was good, all that was fair
All that was me is gone

Sing me a song of a lass that is gone
Say, could that lass be I?
Merry of soul, she sailed on a day
Over the sea to Skye
